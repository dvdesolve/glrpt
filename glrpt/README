This is the working directory of "glrpt" and it must be available in the
user's home directory. Here is a description of files in this directory:

"glrpt.glade" is the GTK3/Glade3 GUI description file and it is loaded
dynamically when glrpt is started. This file contains the complete description
of the Graphical User Interface and it can be modified by the user, provided
it is not damaged. The various widgets describe here can be moved to different
positions in the GUI and their attributes can be changed to some extend.
However, this should only be done by users with some knowledge of this file.

The "images" directory is where glrpt stores any images produced by decoding
the signal from a Meteor M2 type satellite. This directory can be replaced by
a relative link to any other directory chosen by the user, but the link's name
should be "images".

"glrpt" now has the ability to use more than one configuration file, usually
this will be a per-satellite or a per-mode configuration. File names can be
chosen by the user but the must end in ".cfg" if they are to be recognized.
"glrpt" strips this extension from the file names and displays the result in
its "Select Satellite" menu item. Unfortunately the library function that
lists the "glrpt" directory doesn't seem to follow a strict alphabetical order
so these files may appear in any order. Configuration files MUST be reviewed
and edited by the user, as applicable.
